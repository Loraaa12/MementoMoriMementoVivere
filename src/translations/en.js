The heroes know they will die one day so they choose not to fear it - they choose to live and die gloriously. ',
  levskiLetters: 'Levski is an excellent real life example of the principle of "the hero\'s death" - he knows the risks he will undertake to fight for the freedom of Bulgaria, yet he chooses it, he urges others to choose it and he reproaches those who fear the glorious death and value their own lives above freedom.',
  hadjiDimitar: 'Botev goes even further than the concept of the glorious death - he writes that not only does heroism give meaning to your death and purpose to your life, but it also keeps you alive in the eyes of all who witnessed your heroic act - your physical passing becomes the seed of cultural immortality.',

Because if Jack didn\'t understand the meaning of "the hero\'s death", his mom does, and the belief that he died for a greater purpose - for glory, lessens the pain of her grief.',
  lesMiserables: 'A child bridging innocence and activism, Gavroche dies fighting alongside adults. He knows he will die, and he does so without fear, even singing - as if celebrating his own sacrifice.',
  iliad: 'Achilles has already decided to die a glorious death - so much so that he doesn\'t allow anyone else to take his place and kill Hector - to effectively end the war, since that is the greatest glory and he wants to claim it for himself and to justify his death.',
  // Page2 - The Echo
  theEchoTitle: 'The Echo of the Lost',

  journeyToOneselfTitle: 'Journey to Oneself - Blaga Dimitrova',
  journeyToOneself: 'The memory and "echo" of many others is condensed within the narrator, forcing her to move on. She refuses to fail and die, methaphorically or physically, only becuase she\'s built of pieces of others. She herself says she\'s not strong enough to go on, but the pieces she carries force her to keep moving forward.',
  tearsInHeavenTitle: 'Tears in Heaven - Eric Clapton',
  tearsInHeaven: 'Even though the grief of losing a loved one is debilitating, it also forces us to come to terms with death and our own mortality.

  cocoTitle: 'Coco (2017)',
  coco: 'We must remember the lost and keep them in our hearts - because if we forget them, they die a second time. Their death loses its meaning as the bearer of our memento mori.

  anticipatoryGriefTitle: 'Anticipatory Grief',
  anticipatoryGrief: 'In hospice care, families begin to mourn while their loved one still lives. But this grief doesn\'t only weigh—it awakens. They say things unsaid, hold hands more often, listen more closely. Love is no longer automatic—it becomes deliberate. Their soon-to-be absence becomes a shaping presence, and it echoes through our entire existence, shaping it into a more meaningful life.',
  griefObservedTitle: 'A Grief Observed - C. S. Lewis',
  griefObserved: 'With the everpresent looming reminder of death that follows after the passing of a loved one, we have no choice but to internalize that grief and keep on living with it and for it. If not, we just die. If that grief consumes us our only option is to allow it in, to let it be part of us and to let it motivate us, instead of bringing us down. This also ties into the principle of the defiance - if we can\'t defeat the grief, the only way to cope with it is to challenge it and use it.',

  logotherapyTitle: 'Logotherapy - Viktor Frankl',
  logotherapy: 'Frankl argues that true meaning grows from purposeful deeds, especially those that transcend self-centered comforts.

  ourTownTitle: 'Our Town - Thornton Wilder',

That is the memento mori, memento vivere - "Remeber to live, if only in defiance against death".',

The heroine, just by saying these worlds, makes a choice and methaphorically orders her entire life, which in the movie was presented to be on the verge of multiversal collapse. If we choose to survive and to live by our own rules, we can defy death and destructuion in our lives. ',

  //Philosophy
  remember: 'Remember you will die - so live',
  explanationPhilosophy: "The ancient practice of memento mori serves as a powerful reminder of our mortality. This awareness is not meant to instill fear, but rather to inspire us to make the most of our limited time, to cherish our relationships, and to pursue what truly matters. Memento mori acknowledges the inevitability of death, and memento vivere calls us to live with greater purpose and intention.",
  explanationSite:' This site is a collection of thoughts and reflections on the philosophy of memento mori and memento vivere. It splits the concept into 5 themes, that have been distinguished throughout history and art. Each of these themes are somewhat standalone, but are also connected to the others. Many direct references exist between these works, and many of these works fit into more than just one theme connected to the inevitability of death and the call to life. ',
